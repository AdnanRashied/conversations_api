# Introduction to Sinch Conversations API

Welcome to the Sinch Conversations API, a single API to rule them all!  With Sinch's Conversations API developers can now seamlessly integrate omni-channel communications capabilities with their business logic, AI chat bots and human agents, fulfillment and shipping services, or customer support centers.  Combining channel management (SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more) and messaging with built in content transformation, transcoding, and pre-built message templates Sinch removes key complexities from today's diverse communications spectrum and helps you quickly integrate and execute multi-channel campaigns, and more importantly, create powerful engaging conversiations with your users.

Imagine for a second a traveler making a reservation via a large booking site, they have chosen your hotel, they are departing the US and heading to an international location for their business meeting.  On completing the reservation they receive an initial confirmation, reservation number, and booking dates via their preferred channel, SMS.  Our traveler boards their flight and arrives a few hours later at their destination country in South America.  They want to quickly get to their hotel, settle in for the night and prepare for their meetings the next day.  Using WhatsApp, their channel of choice while abroad, they reach out to your WhatsApp Business phone number to request the hotel's exact map location.  Accessing their latest conversation session which started with an SMS booking confirmation you are able to track down their reservation number and hotel details, and can now quickly push back a WhatsApp response with the hotel lat./long. and a carousel list of recommended nearby restaurants that deliver meals.  Through one API, you've managed to track and manage a customer journey (conversation) and made the multi-channel experience pleasing for your customer.  That is the power of Sinch Conversation's API.
